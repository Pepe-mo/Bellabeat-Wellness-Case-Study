The case study will be following the six steps of the data analysis process 

- Ask Phase
- Prepare Phase
- Process Phase
- Analyze Phase
- Share Phase
- Act Phase


## Scenario

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, is a successful small company with the potential to become a major player in the global smart device market. Bellabeat believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could unlock new growth opportunities for the company. The primary focus is to analyze smart device data to gain valuable insights into consumer usage patterns. These insights will then guide and enhance the company's marketing strategy.


## Ask Phase

Business Task: The business task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of smart device usage data for Fitbit. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can inform and enhance Bellabeat’s marketing strategy, thereby driving growth and increasing user engagement and retention.

  Key Stakeholders: 
  Urška Sršen - Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat 
  Sando Mur - Co-founder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team 
  Bellabeat Marketing team


  ## Prepare Phase

### About data set:

Data was generated by respondents to a distributed survey conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and December 5, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to submit their personal tracker data, which included minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 
You can learn more about the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)


#### Limitations in the data set:

1.) The data set does not completely follow the process of good data sources: it has to be Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited (ROCCC), according to a Google Data Analytics Professor. Also according to the [Standard on Data Quality - IAAO](https://www.iaao.org/media/standards/Standard_on_Data_Quality.pdf) data should be accurate, current, consistent, and complete. 
  - Although the data was reliable, original, and cited, the data was not current or comprehensive. For instance, the data was generated in 2016, it is now 2024. This makes the data outdated.
  - The data was not comprehensive because there was missing data, and data was not labeled in a consistent format.

2.) Another limitation was that the sample size was very small and would not be a good representation of actual Bellabeat users. 

3.) Also, the length of time the data was collected was not long enough to give more accurate insights.


## Process Phase

Data was too large for Download in spreadsheets.
Was not able to load all the data sets into BigQuery, just the daily activity data sets were uploaded but not able to load the sleep log and Weight log data sets, as it prompted errors within the rows of data. Row 100 for the sleep log and row 33 for the weight log data sets.

### Note: The combined_weightLog data set has 2 duplicates

### Note: there are columns with insufficient data (containing mainly nulls or zeros)
Then removing columns “LoggedActivitiesDistance” and “SedentaryActiveDistance” from the daily activity data set

## Analyze Phase

This shows that there are 35 users entered in the DailyActivity_data but only 13 users (or data points) in the WeightLog_data. This makes the Weightlog data pose further limitations that would reduce the strength of my recommendations.

To look at the percent distribution of the activity type as compared to total activity minutes

Difficulty creating percent chart in R, needed to redo table in a different format:

This percentage distribution showed that users were sedentary-active most of the time (at about 81% of the time). This might be due to the limitations caused bt by the small sample size.

## Act Phase
### Recommendations:

1.) Using non-Bellabeat data can only give limited insights. 

2.) Obtain actual Bellabeat data through surveys and device-captured user activity.

 3.) Tailor marketing campaigns towards sedentary users that offer promotions to increase activity. Especially on weekdays like Saturdays, Mondays, and Tuesdays

4.) Understanding features that cater to women's health and well-being like self-care and reproductive health might increase usage. 

### Discussion 

The data analyzed to gain insights into user trends and enhance Bellabeat's marketing strategy had several limitations. Due to the small and inconsistent sample size, the findings should be interpreted with caution. To approach the situation more effectively, Bellabeat can consider sourcing more accurate and comprehensive data, either by seeking external data sources or by collecting more robust internal data from Bellabeat users. This would enable the selection of more comprehensive parameters for data collection, resulting in stronger recommendations.

Despite these limitations, the trends indicate that a significant portion of users are sedentary. To address this, Bellabeat could launch targeted marketing campaigns to encourage users to become more active, potentially increasing the usage of Bellabeat's devices.
